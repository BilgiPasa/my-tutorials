Make a GitHub account if you don't have an account. Make a repository.
If you are on Windows, install git from their website. If you use Linux, it is already installed or it is not
installed but when you install GitHub CLI, it automatically gets installed (i think).
Then make a new folder named "GitHub" in your "Desktop" folder (or wherever you want).
Open the "GitHub" folder and do your GitHub work in there.

If you are using Linux, use the terminal for Git and GitHub.
If you are using Windows, use the "Git Bash" application for Git and GitHub.

To install GitHub CLI
{
    If you are using Fedora, enter these commands
    {
        sudo dnf install dnf5-plugins
        sudo dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile=https://cli.github.com/packages/rpm/gh-cli.repo
        sudo dnf install gh --repo gh-cli
    }

    If you are using Debian, enter these commands
    {
        (type -p wget >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt install wget -y)) \
	    && sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings \
	    && out=$(mktemp) && wget -nv -O$out https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
	    && cat $out | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null \
	    && sudo chmod go+r /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
	    && sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/sources.list.d \
	    && echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
	    && sudo apt update \
	    && sudo apt install gh -y
    }

    If you are using Windows, enter this command: winget install -e --id GitHub.cli

    Source: https://github.com/cli/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#linux--bsd
}

Then enter the command "gh auth login" to log in to git using GitHub.
Then enter the command "git config -l | grep credential" to make sure you logged in.
If nothing shows up, enter the command "gh auth login" to log in properly.

Lastly, enter these commands (Linux and Windows)
Write your github email to <your github email goes here> section
Write your github username to <your github username goes here> section
{
    git config --global user.email "<your github email goes here>"
    git config --global user.name "<your github username goes here>"
}

You can check your email and name in your git config like this: git config --list

If you are using Windows, if you want, instead of doing these, you can just use the GitHub Desktop app.
(But I don't use it. I prefer using GitHub in the terminal.)
